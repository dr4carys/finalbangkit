# Final Project Bangkit - Beef and Pork Meat Identification

The increasing consumption of beef in Indonesia provides a loophole for certain parties to reap more profits by cheating. One way is to mix it with pork. Seeing the existing problems, therefore in this project, the we wants to identify beef and pork using CNN.

The model for this dataset is quite simple with only two classes, so we chose this dataset.
